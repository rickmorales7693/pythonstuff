"""
Using some of the collection data types we learned about
in the course so such as a list and dictionary, create a
data structure that best represents the following scenario:

Tom has a salary of 20000 and is 22 years old. He owns a few items such as
a jacket, a car, and TV. Mike is another person who makes 24000 and is 27 years old

"""
There is a list shown below titled original_list.

Using only what you've learned so far in the course,
write code to create a new list that contains the tuple sorted.
